The |busybox| binary in this folder was obtained from 

  http://busybox.net/downloads/binaries/1.19.0/busybox-armv6l

It might be cleaner to build busybox from source as part of B2G's overall
build, but boy, is that hard.

The |list| file was created by pushing the busybox binary to an ARM device and
running ./busybox --list.
